Weed_Name;Treatment;Description;Impact
Carpetweeds;Hand-pulling before seed production, pre-emergent herbicides, or shallow cultivation.;Low-growing annual weed with small, rounded leaves arranged in whorls around the stem.;Competes with crops for water and nutrients, especially in dry conditions.
Crabgrass;Pre-emergent herbicides early in the season, maintaining thick healthy turf to prevent growth.;Annual grass weed with spreading stems that root at nodes, forming a crab-like pattern.;Competes aggressively with crops and can reduce yields by 20-80% in severely infested areas.
Eclipta;Apply herbicides containing bentazon, glyphosate or 2,4-D depending on crop compatibility.;Annual herb with white flower heads and rough, hairy stems and leaves.;Particularly problematic in rice fields and can cause significant yield losses.
Goosegrass;Pre-emergence herbicides or post-emergence control with selective herbicides.;Annual grass weed with flattened stems radiating from a central point, resembling a goose foot.;Highly competitive with crops, especially in warm conditions, and can reduce crop yields by 50-60%.
Morningglory;Pre-plant tillage, post-emergence herbicides containing 2,4-D or dicamba.;Climbing or trailing annual vine with heart-shaped leaves and funnel-shaped flowers.;Vines can wrap around crop plants, making harvesting difficult and reducing yields.
Nutsedge;Specialized herbicides containing halosulfuron or bentazon, repeated applications often needed.;Perennial sedge with triangular stems and extensive underground tuber system.;One of the most problematic weeds worldwide, can reduce crop yields by 20-89% depending on infestation level.
Palmeramaranth;Integrate chemical, mechanical, and cultural control methods due to herbicide resistance concerns.;Fast-growing annual weed with redroot pigweed characteristics, notorious for herbicide resistance.;Can produce over 500,000 seeds per plant and reduce crop yields by up to 91% in severe cases.
Pricklysida;Pre-emergence herbicides containing trifluralin or pendimethalin, or post-emergence options.;Annual broadleaf weed with spiny seed pods and yellow flowers.;Competes with crops and spiny burs can contaminate harvest, reducing crop quality.
Purslane;Mulching, shallow cultivation, or post-emergence herbicides containing 2,4-D.;Succulent annual weed with smooth, reddish stems and small, paddle-shaped leaves.;Drought tolerant and can regrow from stem fragments, competes for nutrients and moisture.
Ragweed;Mowing before flowering, cultivation, or herbicides containing dicamba or glyphosate.;Annual weed with deeply divided, hairy leaves and produces highly allergenic pollen.;Reduces crop yields and its pollen is a major cause of hay fever in humans.
Sicklepod;Early season control is critical; use pre-emergence herbicides or post-emergence options.;Tall annual with sickle-shaped seed pods and compound leaves.;Highly competitive with row crops, can reduce yields by 30-50% and seeds remain viable for years.
Spottedspurge;Pre-emergence herbicides or post-emergence control with products containing 2,4-D.;Low-growing annual with milky sap and small, oval leaves often with a red spot.;Forms dense mats that compete with crops and can reduce soil moisture availability.
Spurredanoda;Pre-plant incorporation of herbicides or post-emergence applications.;Annual broadleaf weed with showy lavender to purple flowers and round, flattened seed pods.;Competes with row crops for resources and can reduce cotton yields by up to 30%.
Swinecress;Early tillage, pre-emergence herbicides, or post-emergence options in appropriate crops.;Low-growing annual with deeply lobed leaves and a pungent odor when crushed.;Problematic in pastures as it can taint milk when consumed by dairy cattle.
Waterhemp;Requires integrated approaches due to widespread herbicide resistance issues.;Tall, aggressive annual weed with long, narrow leaves and small greenish flowers on terminal branches.;Extremely competitive, produces up to 1 million seeds per plant, and can reduce crop yields by up to 70%.
