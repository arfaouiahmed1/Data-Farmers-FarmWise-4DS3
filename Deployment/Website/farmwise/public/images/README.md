# FarmWise Images

This directory contains image assets for the FarmWise application.

## Marketplace Images

Place your marketplace listing images in the following directories:

- `/images/marketplace/` - For marketplace listings (land, equipment, resources)
- `/images/avatars/` - For user avatars

## Placeholder Images

For development purposes, you should add placeholder images with the following names:

### Marketplace:
- `land1.jpg`, `land2.jpg`, `land3.jpg` - For land listings
- `tractor1.jpg`, `tractor2.jpg` - For equipment listings
- `fertilizer1.jpg`, `fertilizer2.jpg` - For resource listings

### Avatars:
- `user-1.jpg`, `user-2.jpg`, `user-3.jpg` - For user avatars

You can use any placeholder image service or stock photos that match the theme. For example:

1. Use a placeholder service like https://placeholder.com/ or https://placehold.co/
2. Use stock photos of agricultural land, tractors, farming resources
3. Use generated images that represent agricultural themes

For testing, you can download free stock photos from sites like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay that are related to farming and agriculture.
