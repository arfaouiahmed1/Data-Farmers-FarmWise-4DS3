# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, analysis, model experimentation, and visualization within the FarmWise project.

Each notebook should ideally focus on a specific task or analysis. Please ensure notebooks are well-documented with explanations of the code, methodology, and findings.

Organize notebooks into subdirectories based on their purpose (e.g., `Data Cleaning`, `Feature Engineering`, `Model Training`, `Visualization`).
