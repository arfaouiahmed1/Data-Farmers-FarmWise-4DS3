# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model development, and experimentation within the FarmWise project.

## Root Directory Notebooks:

- `agriculture-land (1).ipynb`: Notebook likely focused on farm field instance segmentation, potentially using MMDetection based on its name.
- `Satellite.ipynb`: A general notebook possibly used for initial satellite imagery processing or exploration.

## Subdirectories:

### Land Cover

Notebooks focused on land cover classification tasks.

- `land-cover-classification.ipynb`: Explores land cover classification, potentially using Vision Transformers (SegFormer).
- `landcover.ipynb`: Another notebook related to land cover analysis.
- `pids-farmwise-land-cover-classification.ipynb`: Project-specific notebook for land cover classification.

### Satellite

Notebooks specifically for satellite image segmentation tasks.

- `pids-farmwise-satellite-segmentation.ipynb`: Project-specific notebook for satellite image segmentation.
- `satellite-segmentation UNET.ipynb`: Implements satellite segmentation using a U-Net architecture.
- `satellite-segmentation.ipynb`: General notebook for satellite image segmentation experiments.

### Weed Detection

Notebooks focused on the development and evaluation of weed detection models.

- `pids-farmwise-weed-detection.ipynb`: Project-specific notebook for weed detection.
